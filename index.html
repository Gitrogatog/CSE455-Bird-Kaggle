              <h2>Description</h2>
              <p>Our goal with this project was to create a machine learning model based on the Kaggle bird identification training set that could identify the different bird species present with high accuracy. </p>

            <p>In addition, we built our model using a number of pretrained models. These include: </p>

                <li>resnet18</li>

                <h2>Our Approach</h2>
                <p>We tried a number of methods for training our model:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>keep training with the same learning rate for a few epoch (i.e. 2 to 4 epochs)  as long as the loss is still notably decreasing otherwise reduced learning rate and continue training</li>
                    <li>using pre trained features extract through freezing the weights except the fully connected layer</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Training resnet18 process:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>keep training with the same learning rate for a few epoch (i.e. 2 to 4 epochs)  as long as the loss is still notably decreasing otherwise reduced learning rate and continue training</li>
                    <li>using pre trained features extract through freezing the weights except the fully connected layer</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Training only fully connected layer of pretrained resnet50 process:</p>
                <p>training pretrained resnet152 process:</p>

              <h2>Datasets</h2>
              <p>Our only dataset we used was the dataset provided in the Kaggle competition. The dataset is broken down into a training set and a testing set, but the testing set lacks any labels since it’s meant to provide a result for the kaggle competition. To quickly test the accuracy of our model without having to upload our model’s results every time, we tested the model on its training set again. While this may give a slightly skewed result for the model’s accuracy, it’s a good approximation for how our model would respond to an actual test set of images.</p>

                    <h3>What problems did we encounter?</h3>
                    <p>We ran into a number of issues with our model. Our project was made and run in Google Collab, allowing each group member to contribute to and run the model’s code. However, this brought the downside of Google’s runtime limits, which will stop our model from running for more than ~20 minutes. This limits the potential of our model’s accuracy significantly, and required us to weigh the model’s test accuracy with its training efficiency. </p>
