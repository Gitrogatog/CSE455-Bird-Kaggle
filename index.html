              <h2>Description</h2>
              <p>Our goal with this project was to create a machine learning model based on the Kaggle bird identification training set that could identify the different bird species present with high accuracy. </p>

            <h2>Previous Work</h2>
            <p>We tested various pre-trained models, including:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>resnet18</li>
              <li>resnet152</li>
              <li>resnext101</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

        <section id="approach"> 
            <div class="container">
                <h2>Our Approach</h2>
                <p>We tried a number of methods for training our model:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>keep training with the same learning rate for a few epoch (i.e. 2 to 4 epochs)  as long as the loss is still notably decreasing otherwise reduce the learning rate and continue training</li>
                    <li>Freeze the pre-trained model, training only on 3 linear layers. Then, once loss converges on the linear layers, unfreeze the pre-trained model and train the entire model.</li>
                    <li>Use grid search on 1.5% of the data to choose optimal hyperparameters (learning rate and momentum) with 3 epochs, the search went through lr: [1e-5, 1e-4, 1e-3, 1e-2, 1e-1] and momentum: [0.7, 0.8, 0.9]</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Training resnet18 process:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Train with a learning rate of 1e-2 for the first 3 epoch</li>
                    <li>Then train with a learning rate of 1e-3 from 4 to 6 epoch</li>
                    <li>Finally, train for another 4 epochs with smaller learning rate of 1e-4</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Training only the linear fully connected layer of the pretrained resnet50 process</p>
                  <li>Trained only the last fully connected layer of resnet 50</li>
                  <li>In this case it used pretrained feature extractors and learn the classifier</li>
                  <li>Tried a learning rate of 1e-2 for 10 epochs</li>
                  <li>Switched to a learning rate of 1e-4 until 14 epochs</li>
                  <li>Finished with a learning rate of 1e-4 while training until 18 epochs were completed</li>
                  <li>The training loss seemed worse than the pre-trained resnet18 when we were updating the weights for every layer</li>
                <p>training pretrained resnet152 process:</p>
                  <li>Trained with a learning rate of 1e-2 for the first 6 epochs</li>
                  <li>Reduced the learning rate to 1e-3 and trained until 9 epochs completed</li>
                  <li>Continued training with a learning rate of 1e-4 until the loss converged</li>
                  <li>Trained for a few more epochs with a learning rate of 1e-5 to see the effect</li>
                <p>Training resnext:</p>
                  <li>Decreased the learning rate over time as the loss got closer to convergence. Also decreased the momentum, starting at 0.9 and down to 0.5 at the final epoch of training.</li>
                <p>Training resnet152 - fine tuning:</p>
                  <li>Trained the 3 fully connected linear layers for 5 epochs with the pretrained model frozen</li>
                  <li>Unfroze the pre-trained model and trained the entire model until 23 epochs were completed</li>
                  <li>Used grid search to find the best learning rate and momentum values, then trained 3 epochs at a time.</li>

          <section id="data"> 
            <div class="container">
              <h2>Datasets</h2>
              <p>Our only dataset we used was the dataset provided in the Kaggle competition. The dataset is broken down into a training set and a testing set, but the testing set lacks any labels since it’s meant to provide a result for the kaggle competition. To quickly test the accuracy of our model without having to upload our model’s results every time, we tested the model on its training set again. While this may give a slightly skewed result for the model’s accuracy, it’s a good approximation for how our model would respond to an actual test set of images.</p>

              <h2>Discussion</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>What problems did we encounter?</h3>
                    <li>Selecting that model is the best of both worlds in terms of training efficiency and test accuracy. Being able to train with the least number of epochs while still converging at a low loss with a higher accuracy.</li>
                    <li>Not enough time to properly test out many different models</li>
                    <li>Google Colab running out of GPU, transferring checkpoints between accounts for continued training with another account on Colab.</li>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Are there next steps we would take if you kept working on the project?</h3>
                    <p>Further training of the resnet152 model with fine tuning (where we first froze the pre-trained model, then unfroze it later) as it has not converged to some loss yet. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>How does your approach differ from others? Was that beneficial?</h3>
                    <p>We decided to go with a wide approach where we tried many different models. It was detrimental in that training each model until convergence took a long time. It was beneficial in that we got a snapshot of the loss of each model with an idea of how the accuracy would turn out.</p>
